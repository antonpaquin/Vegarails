Weebstack Vegarails.

This is an ongoing project that will eventually give me a complete interface to my "Vega" raspi media server.
Vega is currently being used for mainly anime, also at some point in the future manga
Thus "weebstack"

The goal of this is that I can have my media on the go wherever, and I don't need to stash it all on my laptop.
Not really a space issue, just more of a "proper separation" of where I keep my stuff.
